# us-map

A Javascript map of the United States built with SVG/VML by using Raphael as a jQuery plugin.

You can configure the styles of the states and labels for the default, per state, and hover. You can bind to it through jQuery to capture the events of when users click on states.

I thought I'd share the changes I made for my website: http://www.thepayrollguide.com/State-Taxes

-I only needed Puerto Rico, so I removed the other territories and updated the location of Puerto Rico is put it in a more accurate placement.
-I changed the background color and the hover color.
-As my wordpress did not allow the $ jquery function (it goes undefined), it took me a few hours to figure out how to put the execution into the javascript file.
-the index.html allows you to test the file.
